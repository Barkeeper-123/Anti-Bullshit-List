# Anti-Bullshit-List
List of Bullshit Domains to block with your Pihole. includes Adservers, Tracking services Phishing and Malware Scum.
Enjoy and (almost) Ad-free experience with this huge collection of adlists.
A lot of Domains came from Firebog.net, Peter Lowe's Ad and Tracking Server List and other great sites, my List is just a collection of the best ones I could find.
Prepare for some false positives though because this list is very new and not perfect at all, use it as a base for your list and customise it along the way

I just fixed some issues like the Formation issue and removed all broken/empty list, it works now.
