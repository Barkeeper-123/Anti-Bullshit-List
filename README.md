# Anti-Bullshit-List
List of Bullshit Domains to block with your Pihole. includes Adservers, Tracking services Phishing and Malware Scum.
Enjoy a (mostly) Ad-free experience with this huge collection of ad, tracking and malware-domain lists.

Important : "blocklist-ultra.txt" is discontinued because there were too many false positives and it was a huge mess and it was basically quantity over quality, the current blocklist is guaranteed to work, it blocks all ads on the "canyoublockit.com extreme test" (https://canyoublockit.com) 

Note : The main list is "blocklists.txt" and is a collection of third party lists that I did not create.
whitelist.txt and blacklist.txt is optional but pretty helpful.
