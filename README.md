# Anti-Bullshit-List
List of Bullshit Domains to block with your Pihole. includes Adservers, Tracking services Phishing and Malware Scum.
Enjoy and (almost) Ad-free experience with this huge collection of adlists.

IMPORTANT NOTE : The main list "blocklists-ultra.txt" is under maintenance and I do NOT reccomend ever using it unless you know what you're doing, please use the blocklists.txt It is guaranteed to work and only contains the lists of big creators like Peter Lowe, Dan Pollock, Firebog.net and many more.
blocklists contains the essentials that I use. The main list contains a lot of extra lists that really block some trusted sites which is why im working on fixing the list.
